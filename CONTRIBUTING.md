# Contributing to goose

Want to contribute? Right now, I am more interested in bug reports and help
figuring out git commands than actual code. Basic things are still changing
quite fast, so there is no guarantee a pull request will build the next day. I
am sure this will change once things mature a bit more, so stay tuned.
