# goose

Goose is a git client for your terminal. It is highly inspired by the best git client ever created – magit. It strives to be more
or less identical, with the only difference being that it lives in your terminal, and not in your Emacs.

## Rationale
[Magit](https://magit.vc) is probably the best git client/porcelain around. My only problem is that it lives inside Emacs,
and even though I really enjoy using Emacs I don’t like being tied to one single tool for all my tasks. Hence, I try to move
the best git client out of the best code editor and make it stand alone.

What could possibly go wrong.
